Early dinosaur competitor : lineage that lead to crocodiles
Common ancestor of dinosaurs and pterosaurs : dinosauromorpha 
Oldest dinosaur body fossil : late triassic 
features unique to dinosaurs : widely open acetabulum (hip socket)
feature in dinosaurs not yet present in common ancestor of dinosaurs and pterosaurs : huge body size

Saurischia and Ornithischia recognized on differences in hip
Thyreophora : extra bones on back 
more diverse in Jurassic than Cretaceous : Stegosauria (not ankylosauria)
  Ankylosaur : fused : lizard, body armor fused on back 
Ornithishia is a misnomer 

Pachycephalosaurus head-butting question : absence of bone cells in the head dome 
Ceratopsia geographic distribution : crossed the bering strait 
duckbilled dinosaurs refers to Hadrosauridae 
2 groups of hadrosaurs : solid and hollow crested
Hollow-creseted hadrosaurs : many social behaviors using acoustic communications with whistling sounds
Basal Ceratopsia : margin frill, eye horn, nose horn, rostral bone, tooth battery. Dental battery : tooth batteries, dentition for cutting plants rather than grinding

Intermediate dinosaurs of Ornithopoda, Meginocephalia and Thyreophora : Hypsilophodon, Heterodontosaurus, Lesothosaurus ( not silesaurus ) 
Dental batteris to shear plants : Ceratopsia 
Prosauropoda important ecological role as : large herbivores 
Sauropoda clad that contained : large dinosaurs 
Heribovre jaw design : jaw joint off tooth plane, parallel closure
Sauropoda : thumb claw, quadrapedal
Macronaria : big nose
Longest dinosaurs : Diplodocus, check lecture 9

Toothlessness in theropod dinosaurs observed in clades that became : herbivorous 
Shortest arms in Alvarezsauria and Mononykus (theropod dinosaurs) adapted for : digging 
Largest theropods : spinosaurus, t rex, carcharodontosaurus (not megalosaurus) 
Phylogenic position of aberrant forms among theropod dinosaurs is : derived (toward the tip) 
Largest Theropod size : 10 meters or longer, T. rex : 13 meters, Spinosaurus : 14 meters 
Theropod with largest hands : Therizinosaurus : "reaper lizard", 1 m claw
T rex Senses : can chew bone, enlarged olfactory region (acute sense of smell) average optic region, average cerebrum, elongated cochlea (acute hearing), well developed semicircular canals : good movement tracking, snout postured slightly down 
Herbivorous Maniraptoriform groups : 
  tooth reduction or loss : Ornithomimosauria, therizinosauria, alvarezsauria, oviraptorosauria
  scansoriopterygidae, aviale 
Ostrich dinosaurs : tothless theropods
