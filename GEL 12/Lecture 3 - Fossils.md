## What are fossils 
* Petrified : bone turned to rock
* Fossil : part or all of the body of an organism of the past or its impression, preserved in whatever way
* Fossil plants exist
* Amber : fossil of plant sap
  * there is amber containing animals from those that got stuck in the sap
* Frozen in ice (Frozen mammoth)
* Trace Fossils : image of animal implanted on rock
  * rock molding shape around a shell

## Are "living fossils" fossils?
* Living fossils : living organisms that resemble their fossil ancestors in general shape
  * some of them were once thought to be extinct (not all living fossils)
  * Examples
    * Horseshoe Crab (150 m)
    * Coelacanth (had been thought to be extinct) 
    * Nautilus (300 m)
    * Metasequoia (dawn redwood)
  * Not considered fossils : not organisms of the past

## How are typical fossils made
* Animal dies, sinks to water bed, buried in sediment, compressed (loses volume and changes shape)
* Water in body/bone lost to surrounding during compression
  * water escapes carrying chemicals
  * water simultaneously enters the fossil carriyn outside chemicals
  * Loss of volume, loss of water, exchange of chemical ingredients
* Carbonization : everything is washed away except carbon
* Permineralization : minerals, e.g., phosphates plus silicates, solidifying the peripheral parts of fossils
  * petrified wood, fossils
* Dissolution and Replacement : original minerals dissolve and new minerals replace the spot, keeping the shape

## Likelihood of fossilization 
Fossilization Hurdles
* consumption by other organisms
  * scavengers, maggots, bacteria (consume bones for oxygen)
  * remove oxygen and the bacteria can't consume the bones
* Ways to fossilize
  * Carcasses need to be buried before aerobic bacteria consmue the bones
    * usually underwater in case of dinosaurs
  * Desert Sand Storm (dinosaurs)
  * Tar Pit, Mud Slide, Snow
* Metamorphismm, recyrstalization : loss of shape
  * need to stay near surface
* Erosion : lost forever
* Discovery
Organisms are rarely preserved and found as fossils

## How complete is the fossil record 
Fossil record very incomplete although we don't know exactly how incomplete 
* 8.7 million species of organism are estimated to be present today, of which 2.1 millions have been foudn by humans and given names
* 600 million years of complex life
* how many species turnovers/extinctions?
* species longevity very difficult to determine
* Millions of species but difficult to determine precise number
  * If 99% of species are extinct then 870 million species existed in the past
* Half of the species are insects that don't fossilize well
  * hard body parts better chance to fossilize
* More than 1000 species of dinosaurs known, clearly many more existed 

## How do we find, collect and prepare fossils 
* Prospecting (discovery)
  * Find first specimen, often more nearby
    * take down rocks nearby 
* Collection (excavation)
* Preparation
  * Penumatic Tools
    * air chisels
    * airbrasives
    * hand needles for delicate specimens
    * acids for fossils in limestones (no longer recommended)
      * acid residues could ruin the fossils over decades
