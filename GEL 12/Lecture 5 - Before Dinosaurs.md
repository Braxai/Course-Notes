## What features of dinosaurs were acquired by fish-like far ancestors in water 
* Jaw
  * Upper jaw
  * Lower jaw (mandible)
* Limbs
* Backbone (vertebral column)
* In the sea backbone, jaws, and then limbs were evolved in that order
  * Oldest stem vertebrate : Haikouichthys
  * Primitive vertebrates are jawless (Lamprey)
  * Placodermi : first jaw
  * Lobefinfish : muscular arm and thighs, fins evolved into limbs
  * Tetrapoda, Acanthostega : 8 fingers, evolved down to 5 or less
    * digital arch curving makes limb instead of fin

## What do dinosaurs share wtih mammals 
* New type of egg -- Amniotic membrane
  * Amphibian / Fish egg : embryo eats yolk, disposes of waste, water/oxygen slowly pass through membrane (egg must be small, 1 cm)
  * Mammal Egg : Amniotic/Cleidoic Egg, much bigger, larger hatchlings
    * amnion : protective barrier around embryo
    * yolk sack
    * chorion
    * allantois
    * Enables active oxygen intake, active CO2 output, waste separation, water retention so hatchlings are larger size and can be on land

## When did reptiles and mammals split and in what forms
* Amniota : mammals + reptiles
* Late Carboniferous
* Soon after the split mammals and reptiles looked largely similar, differences were inside especially in the skull
  * Synapsida Skull : one opening behind eye (mammalia)
    * Archaeothyris : appear like reptile but had the mammalia skull
  * Diapsida SKull : two openings behind eye (reptile)
    * Paleothyris

## Are dinosaurs archosaurs or lepidosaurs 
Reptiles : sauria --> lepidosauria and archosauria
* Lepidosauria (common ancestor of squamates and tuatara, and all of its descendants)
  * squamata have scales
    * lizards and snakes
      * snakes a part of lizard lineage
  * tuatara
    * looked like lizard
    * mostly extinct, 1 species in New Zealand
      * mammals couldn't get to NZ until humans arrived and brought them
* Archosaurs (common ancestor of birds and crocodiles, and all of its descendants)
  * gave rise to dinosaurs
  * Lateral Mandibular Fenestra : shared feature of archosaurs
    * appeared slighlty before archosaurs, all archosaurs including dinosaurs had this 

## What are the sisters of dinosauromorphs 
* Dinosaur lineage is sister to the pterosaur lineage, and they together are sister to the crocodile lineage
* Ornithodira : last common ancestor of dinosaurs and pterosaurs, and all of its descendants
* Pseudosuchia : cocodile lineage
