## How do we define a group 
* Clade : common ancestor and all its descendants
  * A group is a clade
* Node Based Definition : identify a common ancestor and define the group as all descendants of that ancestor
  * Other definitions in clude
    * character based definition
    * membership based definition
      * dinosauria first defined by membership

## What are basic terminologies 
* Tree of Life : branching diagram that depicts the 'family' relationships of organismic species
  * phylogeny : framework for evolutionary studies
* root : leads to ancestors
* tips : known species in the tree
* nodes : common ancestors (branching points)
* stem : branch leading to group
* sister groups : branches from same ancestor 

## How do you read relationships from a tree 
* refer to common ancestors

## Whare are synapomorphy and homology 
* Basal : direction toward root
  * Plesiomorphy (basal character) : character state that evolved outside the group being discussed and then inherrited
* Derived : direction toward tip
  * Apomorphy (derived character) : character state that evolved in the group being discussed
    * Two kinds of apomorphy (mutually exclusive)
      * homology : evolved only once in the group being discussed
        * live birth
        * good for characterizing groups
      * homoplasy : evolved twice or more in the group being discussed
        * bipedal
  * Synapomorphy (Shared derived character)
* Character : reproductive style
  * character states : lay egg / live birth

## What is the Linnaean classification 
* Hierarchical system with nesting
  * Kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species
  * italicize species and genus names
  * Binomi(n)al system : species name stated with genus name
    * felis catus, homo sapiens
* Phylogenetic Classification
* Family, Genus, Species regulated by ICZN
  * Family group names should be based on a valid generic name nad have a suffix
    * oidea : superfamilies
    * idae : families
    * inae : subfamilies
  * Principle of Priority : whoever names a species first has the right name (first come first served)

## How do we define Dinosauria
* Identify a common ancestor of all dinosaurs
  * first proposition : last common ancestor of triceratops horridus and passer domesticus (house sparrow)
* Dinosauria : common ancestor of Diplodocus, Triceratops, and house sparrow
  * diplodocus carnegii
