## How long is the geologic time axis
* Earth 4.6 billion years
* Mesozoic (dinosaurs) 

## Where are fossiles found
* Rocks
  * Igneous (rocks of fire) 
    * come from molten
    * Extrusive : quick cooling, tiny crystals or glasy
    * Intrustive : slow cooling, large crystals (granite)
  * Sedimentary (rocks of water) : found near water
    * Weathering and erosion : water, wind, ice
    * Travel to sea, layer on top of eachother and pack the bottom of the oceans
    * Sandstones 
  * Metamorphic (altered rocks) : come from igneous/sedimentary
    * Regional Metamorphism
    * Contact Metamorphism
    * Marbles
* Sedimentary most likely to contain fossils, metamorphic occasionally does 
* Badlands : T. rex

## What is the relative age 
* Sedimentary rock system
* Rarely date fossils themselves
  * Young fossils can be dated if within last 10000 years or so
  * Date the rock containing old fossils
* Three ways to judge the age of a fosssil
  * Biostratigraphy and Index Fossil (Relative Age)
    * Principle of Superposition : younger beds on top
      * land uplifed above water, land tilted, land eroded (old to young rock visible)
    * Map outcroppings, associate line with eras of fossils and use that to merge different outcroppings
      * Divided the rock layer map into four regions : Cenozoic, Mesozoic, Paleozoic, Precambrian
        * Mesozoic subdivided into : Cretaceous, Jurassic, Triassic
        * Relative age : sequence of names given to different parts of a time series of rock strata, with one name older than the other  
  * Radiogenic Isotope Ratio (Absolute Age)
  * Geomagnetic Polarity Chron

## What are typical index fossils 
* Index Fossil: specific species with known time spans
  * Global distribution
    * Pelagic animals
  * Rapid evolution : didn't last long time, narrow time span
    * "small animals"
  * Hard body part
    * shells etc
  * Examples
    * Conodont : eels
    * Ammonites
      * most commonly used for age of dinosaurs 
    * Foraminifera : single cell organism with shells

## How do we place absolute ages on relative ages 
* Radiogenic Isotope Age : radioactive decay, half-lives
  * estimate age of rock
  * Mass Spectrometer : detect subtle differences in the mass of elements
  * Absolute Age determined from layers of volcanic rock
    * combine with fossil relative age to more accurately date time periods
* Geomagnetic Polarity Chron
  * geomagnetic field changes over time
    * magnetism preserved in rocks, create time scale based on when geomagnetic field changed
  * reversal history

## What are important time period names
* Precambrian 4.6 ba - 542 ma
  * age of no life or life without skeletones
* Pahnerozoic
  * Paleozoic 542-251 ma
    * age of complex life
  * Mesozoic 251-65 ma
    * age of reptiles
    * Cretaceous
    * Triassic
    * Jurassic
  * Cenozoic 65-0 ma
    * age of mammals
