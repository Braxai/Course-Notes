### How do we estimate the body mass of a dinosaur, and is it trustworthy 
* Initial Method
  * first used by Gregory 1905
  * measured bolume of scale clay model in water
  * estimated the whole-body density of an alligator ~0.9 g/cm<sup>3</sup>
    * ended up being too light
* Regression Method
  * use known relationship between a body part measurement and body mass
  * 33 --> 200 mammallian species used
    * accuracy not as high as it appears
    * decent estimate
* Volumetric Method
  * estimate the volume and convert it to the mass
  * fit a convex hull onto a 3D scans of dinosaur skeletons
* Cross Checking : considered best to use regression and volumetric for analysis
* Variations in body mass estimates may result from methodological differences
* early estimates of very heavy dinosaurs are unlikely to be true

### How fast were dinosaurs when walking and running 
* Trackway : multple foot prints lined up
  * measure spacing of footprints in a trackway
  * stride : distance between same sided foot prints
  * pace : difference in opposite side footprints
* stride length is correlated with speed, per species
  * normalize across species with leg length
* speed estimates suggest cold blooded
* Fastest trackway :
  * hip height : 1.98 m
  * run : 29.2 km/h
  * walk : 6.8 km/h
* can tell animal is running if trackway is along single line

### Did T. rex run
* needed extra muscle to maintain balance
  * would need unreasonably massive muscles to maintain balance and run
  * estimate suggests t rex could not run

### What kind of animals have night visions 
* nocturnal animals
  * large eyes
* activity patterns with intermediates
  * nocturnal : night active
  * diunal : day active
  * cathemeral : feed during day and night, short sleeping hours
    * why cathemeral? need to eat a lot
    * daytime not long enough for collecting enough food if you are about the size of a pig or larger
  * crepuscular : most active at dawn and dusk
* most reptiles diurnal, most mammals nocturnal

### Were there any nocturnal dinosaurs
* eye characteristics of diurnal and nocturnal
  * larger eye opening in nocturnal
* activity pattern summary
  * not many diurnal dinosaurs
    * small herbivores
  * many cathemeral dinosaurs
    * large species
  * some nocturnal dinosaurs
    * small carnivores

### Were there any nocturnal avialans or pterosaurs
* flying vertebrates activity patterns today
  * most birds diurnal
  * most bats nocturnal
* Avialae in the data are all diurnal
* Pterosaurs split more evenly between diurnal and nocturnal
  * some crepuscular others diurnal
