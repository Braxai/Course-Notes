### When did land plants appear 
* First plant : Ordovician
* Oldest land plant fossils
  * hornworts
  * liverworts
* Avascular --> Vascular plants (spores both)
  * vascular plants can carry water from root and grow taller
  * Vascular appeared in Silurian
  * tracheid cells in the xylem 
* Spores --> Seed plants
  * Seed plants : gymnosperm, angiosperm
* Tall Trees appeared in the Devonian
  * Archaeopteris

### What land plants were there when dinosaurs appeared
* Tropical Swamp Forests in carboniferous
  * died, compressed in rock, turned into coal
* Vascular plants with spores flourished
* Seed plants appeared in this time
  * minority since world warm and humid
  * in Permian evironment became dry and cool, seed plants rapidly grew
* Conifers take over in the Triassic
  * vegetation in dinosaur age dominated by conifers and cycads in most paleoreconstructions

### What plant group appeared while dinosaurs roamed the land, when, and in what form
* Flowering plants
  * early Cretaceous
  * vascular system improvement : vessel cells in the xylem
    * every flower has this except Amborella (most primitive angiosperm today)
* Montsechia : oldest unequivocal fossil angiosperm
* Archaefructus : previous oldest unequivocal fossil angiosperm
* Water Lily's appear in Cretaceous
* Grasses appear in mid Cretaceous
  * grass phytolith fossils
    * not good for herbivores, chewing these grasses would erode teeth slightly
* Angiosperm genus richness spike in Cretaceous
  * many herbivore animals thrived when this happened

### Where were the land masses 
* Pangea / superocean
* Plate Tectonics : continental drift
* earthquakes at boundaries of plates
* When dinosaurs appear 220 ma pangea
* 200 ma Trassic ended with a mass extinction
* 150 ma continents breaking apart
* 120 ma further continental drift
* 90 ma north america divided into three masses
  * high sea level made western interior sea
* 66 ma looking similar to today, about when dinosaurs went extinct
  * continents now have uniquely defined dinosaurs
* Continents in the age of dinosaurs : started out with the supercontinent Pangaea, which gradually broke apart through the age of dinosaurs
  * contintents moved carrying dinosaurs, continents broke apart separating dinosaurs

### Was the sea level high or low 
* Mesozoic : sea level changed from low to high
* generally much higher sea level than today (200 m)
  * low at the beginning of the age of dinosaurs
  * high sea level made environment moist, effects plants, which effects dinoaurs
  * lots of shallow seas when the water level became high
* sea levels : started low in triassic but became high towards the cretaceous

### Did the averge temperature fluctuate in the age of dinosaurs
* Warm climate
* Jurassic cooler than the rest of the dinosaur age
* No ice cap in age of dinosaurs
* always higher than it is today, even if there was a little bit of drop in the middle
