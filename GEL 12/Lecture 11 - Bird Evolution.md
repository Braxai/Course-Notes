### What type of feathers do birds have
* Plumulaceous feather : down, down feather, downy feather
  * good for keeping heat, not good for flying
* Pennaceous feather : typical flight feather
  * vanes may be separated
  * branching off Rechis
* Types of feathers
  * tail : symmetrical
  * flight : asymmetrical
  * semiplume
  * filoplume
  * bristle
  * downy

### What type of feathers did dinosaurs have before birds 
* First feathered dinosaur fossil : Sinosaurpteryx
  * many single filaments without branching
    * not pennaceous, plumulaceous, or mammalian hair
  * Filamentous feather : ancestral feather
* Coloration : darker feathers with melanin are preserved but not light-colored ones
  * pigments preserved, not actual feathers
* Protarchaeopteryx : dinosaur with pennaceous feather
* Feather evolution : filamentous, plumulaceous, pennaceous

### Did dinosaurs have wings before birds
* Theropods with wings : fossil evidence of wings is known in three to four lineages of theropods but only one of them led to bird wings 
  * scansoriopterygidae
    * scandorio-pteryx : scansorial wing
      * scansorial : back and forth between ground and tree
    * Yi : early sign of wings
    * gliding animal, no flight feather, wing membrane
    * intermediate feather evolution 
  * dromaeosauridae
    * dromaeo-saurus : running-lizzard
    * deinonychus (hyperextention second toe)
    * Microraptor : had wings, not enough muscle to continuously fly but could glide, had pennaceous feathers
    * Dromaeosaur with feathers : sinosaurornithoides
    * Quill knobs : attachment for feathers (velociraptor) 
  * anchiornithidae (may belong to avialae)
    * anchi-ornis : near-bird
      * frequently moved around evolutionary tree
      * striped pattern
      * avialae or troodontidae? unsure
  * avialae

### Which theropod dinosaurs gave rise to birds 
* Avi - alae : bird - wings
  * had wings homologous to bird wings
  * All species that are more closely related to modern birds than to Deinonychus or Troodon
  * Archaeopteryx
    * still had a longer tail
    * hand not completely bird like yet, enlarged more than typical dinosaur hand
    * doesn't have developed breast bone/muscles that would indicate ability to flap wings and fly
    * often called first bird, but not true bird
    * had hyperextensible joint
* Aves : last common ancestor of modern birds and all of its descendants

### Were there true birds in the age of dinosaurs
* Baminornis : fhort tail pygostyle from late jurassic
* Water birds : lived in sea
  * Hesperonis
    * wing bones became a rod
    * no wing, swimming
* Icthyornis
  * modern looking breastbone
* Vegavis : cretaceous goose relative
  * earliest record of modern birds
