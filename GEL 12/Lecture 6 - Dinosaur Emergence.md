## Did the first dinosaurs have competitors 
* Synapsid competitors
  * mammal side of amniota
    * Cynognathus : carnivore, biggest predator on land at the beginning of the triassic
    * Lystrosaurus : heribove
* Reptile advantage
  * average global temperature much higher during the Mesozoic
  * crocodile, pterosaurs, lizards
    * crocodiles the largest competitor with dinosaurs
    * Pseudosuchia : crocodile ancestor
      * stood up, limbs below the body not on side
      * crocodile skull flattened in jurassic and crocodiles became sprawling creatures returning to the water

## What did the common ancestor of dinosaurs and crocodile look like 
* Aphanosauria : basal clade along stem that led to dinosaurs
  * Telocrator (middle triassic)
    * quadrupedal, standing up, meat eater
    * ankle
* Features expected in the common ancestor between crocs and dinosaurs
  * quadrupedal, carnivorous, standing (erect posture)

## What are dinosauromorphs and what did the common ancestor of dinosaurs and pterosaurs look like
* dinosauromorpha containing dinosaurs and some stem animals, sometimes called "dinosauromorphs"
* dinosauromorphs (dinosaur shapes)
  * Two clades of dinosauromorphs
    * Marasuchidae : Marasuchus, carnivore
    * Silesauridae : Asilisaurus, Silesaurus, herbivore / omnivore
    * Tip-toe posture is shared with dinoaurs, including birds
    * Appear in Chanares (early Triassic)
* Dinosaurs appear in middle Carnian period of Triassic

* Start in Africa, move to South America, up to North America and Europe (all in Pangea)

* Pterosaur Lineage
  * Lagerpetidae
    * ankle in air, carnivore
* Features expected in the common ancestor between dinosaurs and pterosaurs
  * bipedal, carnivorous, tiptoe-walking (ankle in air)
* Limb Posture Evolution : quadrupedal to bipedal from crocs to pterosaurs
  * flat foot to tip toe walking
* Diet evolution both carnivorous

## What did the earliest dinosaurs look like and what features did they share
* Earliest dnosaurs from Argentina
  * Staurikosaurus
  * Oldest Dinosaur fossil
    * Herrerasaurus
  * Eoraptor : carnivore, possibly omnivore
  * Eodromaeus
* Slightly younger dinosaurs from Brazil
  * Guaibasaurus
  * Saturnalia
* Triassic Dinosaurs
  * Saurischia (lizard-hip) : all of the species above are lizard-hip
  * Ornithischia (bird-hip)
* Pisanosaurus : triassic herbivore that turned out to be not a dinosaur (dinosauromorph)

* Cross-Checking Owen's features
  * at least five fused vertebrae in the pelvis : no, 2-3
  * held their limbs under the body : no, dinosauromorph/pterosauromorphs had this
    * plesiomorphy : erect posture, tiptoe walking (not defining characteristics)
  * Terrestrial, not aquatic is not considered a characteristic
* Dinosaur Synapomorphy : widely open acetabulum (hip socket)
  
## When did dinosaurs appear and where are the earliest forms found
* Dinosaurs
  * mid Carnian, early late Triassic (Herrerasaurus), South America
  * North America dinosaurs appear shortly after
* Nyasasaurus
  * possible dinosaur or dinosauromorph, too fragmentary bones to tell whether it is a dinosaur or not
* South America : Early Late Triassic (Carnian)
* North America and Europe : Middle Late Triassic (Norian)
