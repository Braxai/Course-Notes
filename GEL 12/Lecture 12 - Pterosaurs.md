### What are pterosaurs and their basic features
* Ptero - sauria : wing - lizard
  * controversial : did the wing reach the ankle
* wing formed by extension of 4th digit
* collagen fibers in the wing membrane
  * orientation along stress distribution, increases strength
* 4 to 5 toes
* feathers in a limited number of pterosaurs body covering
  * may or may not be the same as the dinosaur feather 

### What are typical vs "primitive" pterosaur body designs
* long or short tail, without much muscle
  * long tail more primitive
* pterodactyloidea : short tail
* Basal "primitive" pterosaurs
  * two types of teeth
  * robust but empty wing bones
  * carbonate platform habitat
* Intermediate pterosaurs
  * lighter
  * long tail
  * only fish eating teeth
* Slightly derived
  * short tail
  * water pterosaurs
  * not the best at flight
* derived
  * pteranodon : 7 m wing span
  * short torso
  * fused backbones
  * Quetzalcoatlus : biggest pterosaur, estimated 10 m wingspan

### When and where did pterosaurs live 
* Slightly later than dinosaurs, late triassic through cretaceous
  * thrived in cretaceous
* started in wester europe and spread worldwide
* lived mostly near the sea
  * some spread inland

### How big or small were pterosaurs compared to birds and bats 
* smallest
  * Nemicolopterus : wing span ~250 mm
  * smallest bird : humming bird, several grams
  * smallest bat : bumbleebee bat : few grams
* largest
  * quetzalcoatlus : 10 m wingspan
  * biggest bird : wandering albatross 3.5 m wingspan
  * biggest bat : flying fox 1.8 m wingspan

### Could large pterosaurs fly 
* heaviest bird that can fly : kori bustard 20 kg
* larger birds cannot flap and fly because the weight of the muscle to drive the wings becomes heavier than the weight that can be supported by the wing
* aspect ratio : descriptor of how elongated the wing is
  * high aspect ratio, elongated wing, frequent flyer
    * great at gliding without flapping much
  * low aspect better for quick burst of energy, escaping danger
* wing loading : how much body mass supported by given area of wing
  * high wing loading : more weight to carry per area, flap more often
* pterosaurs may have been able to wait for the wind, use it to get airborn, and then glide

### What did pterosaurs eat and what ate them
* living along the sea : ate fish and squid
* living in the forrest : likely inects
* giant pterosaurs : don't know
* pterosaurs caught in the water were easy prey for aquatic animals
* velociraptor ate pterosaurs
