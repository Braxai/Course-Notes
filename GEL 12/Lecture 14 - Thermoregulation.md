### What are metabolic rates
* Metabolic Rate : energy expenditure per unit time
  * usually measured by how much oxygen is respired per unit time
* energy expenditure per unit time at rest
  * Basal Metabolic Rate (endotherms)
  * Standard Metabolic Rate (ectotherms)
* Exercise metabolic rate > basal metabolic rate

### What does warm-blooded mean 
* characteristics of warm blooded animals
  * Homeothermy : ability to keep body temperature constant
    * Constant in the body core
  * Endothermy : use energy inside body to maintain body temperature
    * about 3/4 of the heat comes from internal organs compared to skin and muscle
    * warm-blooded : maintain hgh body temperature (>30 C) with endothermy - mammals and birds
  * Stenothermy : body tuned to work at narrow range of temperatures best
    * TNZ : thermal neutral zone - range of temperatures that is most efficient
* cost : spend many times more energy than reptiles of same body mass

### How do typical reptiles regulate their temperatures 
* fluctuates 10-20 C throughout day
* eat significantly less food
* maintain body temperature close to outside temperature
  * body usually slightly warmer than outside
* use external heat to warm up
  * minimize heat loss
  * ectohermy

### What is gigantothermy
* heat generation proportional to body volume
* heat loss proportional to body surface
* larger animals overheat because they have too much volume and not enough surface
  * opposite for small animals
  * larger animals better at keeping heat inside the body
* gigantothermy :
  * easier to keep constant body temperature in low ambient temperature
  * easier to overheat in a high ambient temperature
* Leatherback turtles : homeothermic but not endothermic, not warm blooded

### What body part is necessary for constantly high metabolism
* warm blooded animals need to respire a lot of air --> heat loss, moisture loss
* Nasal Turbinate : device to reduce heat and water loss during breathing
* Device for efficient gas exchange
  * bird air-sac system
    * lung airflow is unidirectional
      * lizards and crocodiles have this but don't have high metabolic rate
        * not necessary for high metabolism
  * get more oxygen from the same amount of air

### Were dinosaurs warm-blooded
* No nasal turbinates
  * suggests they were not warm-blooded
* larger nasal cavaity than crocodiles but not as large as birds or mammals for given body size
* dinosaurs with feathers (body insulation) tried to keep body warm, which reptiles don't do
  * may have had slightly raised metabolic rate but not the same as warm-blooded
* growth rate
  * similar to marsupial but not human
  * some cold-blooded animals have the same growth rate as marsupials
* gigantothermy
  * had to worry about overheating, did not need high metabolic rates
* body temperature
  * theropod egg similar to reptile egg rather than birds
* Mesothermy (middle of cold and warm blood)
  * Some dinosaurs may have had slightly higher body temperatures than typical reptiles for various reasons
  * did not quite have the physiology of warm-blooded animals today
