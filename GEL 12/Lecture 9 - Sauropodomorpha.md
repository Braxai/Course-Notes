### What are intermediate ornithischians 
* Cerapoda : Ceratopsian and Ornithopods
* Genasauria : "cheeked lizard" - Cerapoda + Thyreophora
  * Neornithischia : after common ancestor Genasauria
* Three Intermediate Lineages
  * Lesothosaurus
  * Hypsilophodontidae
  * Heterodontosauridae

### Did all herbivorous dinosaurs eat plants the same way 
* Plier model
  * Needle Nose : joint on tooth plane
    * radial closure as in carnivore jaws 
  * Channel Lock : join off tooth plane
    * parallel closure as in herbivore jaws
      * not all herbivore jaw joints offset far from the tooth line
* Dental Batteries : dentitions to match parallel jaw closure
  * grinding surface
    * exception : Ceraopsian dental battery for shearing instead of grinding
* Ornithischian jaws may look similar but have different jaw mechanics
  * achieved similar performance in different ways

### What are Sauropodomorpha
* Long neck and small head
* Sauro-poda-morpha : lizard-leg-form
* Prosauropodsare basal sauropodomorhps that are bipedal and not truly gigantic yet

### What are "Prosauropoda" and why are they important 
* before : lizard : leg
* Thecodontosaurus
  * possibilities of insectivory or at least omnivory
* Plateosaurus
  * thumb-claw
  * historically well known
* First major dinosaur herbivore that took over other herbivores
  * Triassic Takeover, could stand up to reach leaves in trees

### What are Sauropoda and how do they differ from "prosauropods"
* Sauro-poda : Lizard-leg
* Volcanodon : basal sauropoda
  * thumb-claw
* Quadrapedal, wouldn't stand up and walk with hind legs
* Neosauropoda
  * macronaria
    * big nose
      * possibly for getting rid of heat
    * bulky, heavy
    * camarasaurus
    * brachiosaurus
      * shoulder joint higher than hip joint
      * originally thought to be lviing in water
        * disproven, wouldn't have been able to breathe with lungs so far underwater where there is more pressure
        * empty bones wouldn't caused the to float in water
    * giraffatitan
    * Titanosaurs
      * saltasaurus
        * smaller with body armor
    * Alamosaurus
      * bulkiest sauropoda
    * Patagotitan
    * Argentinosaurus
      * heaviest animal ever : largely estimated from small amount of bones 
  * diplodocoidea
    * Diplodocus
      * longest dinosaur
    * Slender and long, less bulky than macronaria
    * Apatosaurus
      * unusually bulky
    * Amargasaurus
