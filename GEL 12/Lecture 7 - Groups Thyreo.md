### How do you divide dinosaurs into two groups 
* Harry Seeley proposed in 1887 
 * Saurischia "Lizard-Hip"
  * Pubis goes down
  * Give rise to birds later, unintuitive 
 * Ornithischia "Bird-Hip"
  * Pubis goes towards front
  * Bird-hip isn't a great name because not all pubis bones in dinosaurs go back (triceratops)
   * continued to use because it has been used for so long

### How do you divide dinosaurs into seven groups 
* Theropoda "Beast-legs"
 * meat eating jaws
* Sauropodomorpha
 * giants, tiny head, long neck
* Ceratopsia "Horn-faces"
 * horns, frills around head
* Pachycephalosauria "Thick-headed-lizards"
* Ornithopoda "Bird-legs"
 * large land herbivores
* Stegosauria "roof-lizards"
* Ankylosauria "Fused-lizard"
 * armored

5 bird-hip and 2 lizard-hip

* alternative tree proposed bird-hip dinosaurs may descend from lizard-hip dinosaurs 

### What are Thyreophora
* extra bones on back : plate, armor, spike
* Thyreophora --> shield carrier
* ancestral Threophora
 * Scutellosaurus, bipedal small and light, herbivore with some armor
 * Scelidosaurus : larger, body length x2 results in body mass x8 as heavy
  * likely bipedal and quadrapedal spending most time walking on all four because of body mass

### What are stegosaurs, how did they live, and when
* Stego - sauria : roof - lizard
* Bone structure
 * collection of small bones protecting throat
 * small head for the body
 * three supraorbital bones : extra bone above the eye socket (usually one or two, one extra)
 * predentary bones : found in all bird-hip dinosaurs
* Plates
 * plate size and number varied among stegosaurs, may have spike instead of plates
 * in some species plates act as sexual dimorphism
 * Thermoregulation : possible function given pores on plate and blood vessels running through them
* Teeth for browsing : collect leaves from branches
* extremely small brain
 * second brain in hip?
  * Marsh foudn big cavity in the sacrum of Stegosaurus and argued that there was a second brain there being larger than the first one
  * denied today, likely glycogen body, function unknown in birds today
 * limited body control and movement
* about a dozen species, not diverse
* largely jurassic animals 

### What are ankylosaurs, how did they live, and when
* Ankylo - sauria : fused - lizard
 * Body armored fused bones on back
 * tail club, chunk of bone
  * some with no tail defense had shoulder defenses
* dentition
 * shovel like snout
 * browsing teeth
 * complex and large nose cavity
  * smell and consume plant material under ground like roots
* aroudn 60 species
* around in jurassic, thriving in cretaceous
