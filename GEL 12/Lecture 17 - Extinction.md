### What is the K/Pg boundary
* Cretaceous / Paleogene
  * age of dinosaurs --> age of mammals
* K/T : cretaceous / tertiary
  * tertiary outdated term refferring to the part of the Cenozoic before the quarternary
  * old name, means same as K/Pg
* Dark colored rock
  * excavated compared to surrounding rock
  * large amount of carbon
* Iridium anomaly at the K/Pg Boundary
  * iridium spike
    * extraterrestrial or deep in the earth

### Were dinosaurs already in decline before the mass extinction
* decline of diversity started slightly before the K/Pg mass extinction in many dinosaur groups, especially within the Maastrichtian
  * even then diversity was higher than in the mid Cretaceous
* unlikely this decline lead to mass extinction

### What are the Deccan Traps
* Area in India where something continuously erupted for more than two hundred thousand years
* Deccan Traps : layers and layers of lava flows of different ages, unusual amount of volcanic rock
  * started long before K/Pg and ended after K/Pg
* Flood Basalt : lava with water like consistency, can flow without sealing the surface breach
* Not active at time of K/Pg boundary, was resting at the time

### What is the Chicxulub structure
* K/Pg bolide impact
  * Bolide : huge meteorite impact
  * sceptics until crater found
* Crater found at Northern end of YUcatan Peninsula
  * crater was burried
  * ~180 km across, 20 km deep
* measured Gravity Anomaly
* impact created carbon layer from a large amount of soot (things burning)
* Bolid hit at an angle, molten rock flew into one direction more than another
  * ejecta covered North America continent at the time
    * American scientists overestimated the significance of the extinction because of this
  * molten rock falling sparked fires
* hit water surface and caused massive flooding

### Was it an instantaneous kill
* Microwave summer from returning ejecta
  * wild fires happening all around the globe
  * ejecta that flew high into the sky would fall down elsewhere in the world because of Earth's rotation
* impact winter : winter lasting for more than a few years from dust and soot shielding the sunlight
  * plants can't get light
  * especially prevelant in northern hemisphere
* acid rain from sulfur in ejecta
* greenhouse effect from CO2
  * global warming
* about 75% of species went extinct
* could have taken decades or so, maybe a millenia

## What survived and what did not 
* Survivors
  * amphibians "cold-blooded"
    * frogs
    * salamanders
    * caecilians
  * reptiles "cold-blooded"
    * snakes
    * lizards
    * crocodiles
    * turtles
  * birds "warm-blooded"
    * many cretaceous birds went extinct
  * mammals "warm-blooded"
  * large species went extinct
  * some small sepcies went extinct
* Victims
  * dinosaurs
  * marine reptiles
    * icthyosaurs extinct long before K/Pg boundary
  * ammonites
  * belemnites
* no conclusion about what differntiated the small species that survived or not
  * helped to be able to lower metabolic rate (hybernation) 

### Were all mass extinctions similar
* Five big mass extinctions
  * End Ordovician
  * Frasnian-Famenian
  * End Permian
  * End Triassic
  * K/Pg
    * most recent
* each killed at least 75% of species
* Large igneous provinces, especially flood basalts
  * flood basalts may be relevant at lest to the last three mass extinctions
* Bolid impact is well-established only for the K/Pg mass extinction
  * impact winter
* global warming limited for K/Pg
  * at least 2, maybe 4 of the mass extinctions involved global warming
  * long term global warming assocaited with end permian P/T
    * almost 90% of species went extinct : worst mass extinction
* each mass extinction had a unique set of causes
