### What makes a reptile marine 
* Marine Tetrapods : four limbed vertebrates that re-invaded the sea
  * Land vertebrates colonized the sea at least 69 times
* Problems of land vertebrates living in sea
  * hold breath
  * develop mechanism to remove salt from body
  * combat heat loss
  * learn to move efficiently in water
  * adjust to dim environment
* Marine : animals that feed in the sea
  * probably swim in the sea
  * not necessary to give birth in sea or spend majority of time in sea

### What are the major groups of marine reptiles in the Mesozoic 
* Today : marine iguana, sea turtles, sea snakes, sea kraits
  * sea turtles the only one from age of dinosaurs
* Three major groups 
  * Sauropterygians (largest group)
    * divided into somewhat turtle looking Placodontia nad long-necked Eosauropterygia
      * Placodonts
        * may be armored or unarmored 
        * shell eaters with crushing teeth
      * Eosauropterygians
        * long necked from beginning
        * limbs evolved into "Wings" used to fly underwater, no knee or elbow bend
        * Plesiosaurs
          * Sauropterygia : short necked
            * down to 18 neck bones
            * large heads
  * Icthyosaurs (2nd largest group)
    * fish shaped
      * from lizard to fish shape
    * Large eyes
      * largest eye to ever exist in vertebrates
      * good for seeing in dark, deep diving
  * Mosasaurs (3rd largest group)
    * sea going lizards
      * started from swimming lizards
    * good swimmers with flippers and fluke
    * danerous predator in the Cretaceous 
* Many smaller groups
  * thalattosuchians : sea going crocodiles
  * sea turtles
  * thalattosaurs
  * pleurosaurs
  * more

### What was the largest marine reptile 
* Largest Sea Turtle
  * Archelon : up to about 4 m
* Largest Mosasaur : 10 - 12 m
  * possibly 15 / 18 m
* Largest Pliosaur - short neck plesiosaurs
  * about 12 m possibly 15 or 18 m
* Largest Elasmosaur - long necked plesiosaurs
  * about 12 m possibly 15 m
* Largest Ichthyosaur
  * up to about 14 m possibly 15 m
  * largest up to about 20 m possibly 23 m --> biggest marin reptile ever

### What reptile had the longest neck 
* Elasmosaurus
  * 72 neck bones
* Albertonectes
  * 76 neck bones
  * 7 m long neck
* Dinocephalosaurus : Triassic marine reptile lineage that predates plesiosaurs
  * 32 neck bones, longer neck bones

### Did marine reptiles give live birth
* Not unusual for reptiles to give live birth
  * live birth evolved more than 100 times in lizard sand snakes
  * Archosaurs (crocodiles, turtles, and birds) all lay eggs and never give live birth as far as known
* Tail-first birth important because it takes a long time and if head first the animal would drown
* Sea Sanke Pelamis : tail first birth in the sea
* Marine tetrapods tend to give birth tail-first in water, although babies do come out headfirst occasionally and survive
* some marine mammals give birth headfirst on land
* Mosasauroidea
  * giving birth
  * curled up babies
  * head first or tail first unknown
* Sauropterygia
  * giving birth
  * curled up babies
  * head first or tail first unknown
  * one big baby like whales
* Icthyosaurs
  * giing birth
  * tail first
* yes many gave live birth, Icthyosaurs came out tail first
