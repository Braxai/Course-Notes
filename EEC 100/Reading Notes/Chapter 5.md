String Gage : grid of thin wires whose resistance changes when the wires are lengthened or shortened according to the equation  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/263fd5f4-c729-462e-b95d-de8a203b8eea)
- R resistance, deltaL/L fractional lengthening of the gage (strain)
- type of transducer, which is a device that measures the metal bar in the bending angle
