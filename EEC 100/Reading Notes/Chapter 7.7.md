Integrating amplifier generates an output voltage proportional to the integral of the input voltage
Analysis 
- is = if = 0
- vn = vp = 0
Using ohms law and capacitor current relationship ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9e0731e-f460-4aec-bf90-893120a74d31) if we substitute into KCL equation and solve it gives

Multiply both sides by dt and integrate from to to t

If no energy stored in the capacitor it reduces to
