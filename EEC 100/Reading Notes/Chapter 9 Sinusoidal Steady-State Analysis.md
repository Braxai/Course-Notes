### 9.1 The Sinusoidal Source
Sinusoidal Voltge Source (independent or dependent) : produces voltage that varies sinusoidally with time 
Sinusoidal Current Source (independent or dependent) : produces current that varies sinusoidally with time 
- expressed with sin or cos

Amplitude : V<sub>m</sub>
Period ( T ) : time required for the function to pass through all its possible values, measured in seconds
Frequency ( f ) : 1 / T , measured in Hz ( cycles per second )
