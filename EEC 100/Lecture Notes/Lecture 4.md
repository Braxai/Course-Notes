v1 = 10cos(wt+50) = 10cos(wt-130) --> subtracted 180 degrees
v2 = 12sin(wt-10) = 12cos(wt-100) --> subtracted 90 degrees to convert sin to cos
v2 is leading v1 by 30 degrees

Phasor and Laplace transform can simplify the process to solve the circuit 

Phasor : complex number that represents the amplitude and phase of a sinusoid

Phasor may be regarded as a mathematical equivalent of a sinusoid with the time dependence dropped

Because a phasor has amplitude and phase, it behaves as a vector such graphical representations of phasors is known as a phasor diagram

Phasor Relationships for Circuit Elements
- If we want to apply the phasor transform in circuit analysis, we first need to establish the relationship between the current and voltage R, L, and C in phasor domain
