How to determine relationship between Vout, v1 and v2
- Op-Amp and negative feedback
- find i, no current on branch 1 or 2
- find difference between v01 and v02
- use difference amplifier equation

Solve first two inverting amplfiers then treat last as a summing amplifier using superposition to find 6V answer
- summing amplifier is on inverting terminal so -6 becomes 6
