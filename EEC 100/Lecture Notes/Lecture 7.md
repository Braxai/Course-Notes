Active Filter contains gain that can control the output 

Bode Diagrams 
- provide simple sketch of the frequency response H(jw) as a function of w
- body diagram plot is a straight-line approximation of H(jw) and simplifies the determination of the graphical portrayal of the frequency response
  - Amplitdue plot: 20log10|H(jw)| vs log10w (log scaled w)
  - Phase plot: theta(jw) vs log10w (log scaled w )
- Units of 20log10|H(jw)| are called decibels and denoted dB
