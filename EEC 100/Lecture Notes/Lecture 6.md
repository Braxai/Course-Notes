Passive Filter 

Filtering : type of analog signal processing
Filters : frequency-selective circuits that filter out certain input signals based on their frequency 
  - telephone transmission system suffers from 60 Hz interference caused by nearby power utility lines. If an appopriate filter is designed the 60 Hz interference can be eliminated

Frequency Response 
- if we allow the frequency of excitation to become a variable and evaluate the performance as a function of frequency, we can consider the effect of varying frequency on elements with which we already quite familiar (resistor, inductor, and capacitor)
