Scaling 
- In designing and analyzing filters, it is sometimes convenient to work with element vlues of 1 ohm, 1H, 1F and then transform the avlues to realistic values by scaling
- Impedance Scaling : icnreasing all impedances in a circuit by a factor
  - frequency response remains unchanged
- Frequency Scaling : shifting frequency response of a circuit left or right the frequeuncy axis while leaving the impedances in the circuit the same
- Impedance and Frequency Scaling : combination of impedance scaling and frequency scaling
