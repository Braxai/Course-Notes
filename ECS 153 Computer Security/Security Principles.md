# Security Principles
### 1.1 Know your threat Model 
Threat Model : model of who your attack is and what resources they have
- who and why might someone attack?

Common Assumnptions to take into account about attackers
1. can interact with your systems without anyone noticing
2. has general information about system (OS, software vulnerabilities, etc.)
3. is persistent and lucky, will attack as many times as necessary
4. has resources required to undertake attak
5. can coordinate several complex attacks across various sysetms
6. every system is a potential target

### 1.2 Consider human factors 
Security systems must be usable by ordinary people and must take into account usabilitiy 
- fool-proof user-friendly options ideal 

### 1.3 Security is economics
Systems need only need to be protected against a certain level of attacks; expected benefit of paid security defense should be proportional to the expected cost of the attack
- cost benefit analysis

Focus energy on securing weakest links
- Conservative Design : sytems should be evaluated according to the worst security failure that is at all plausible, under assumptions fabvorable to the attacker 

### 1.4 Detect if you can't prevent

### 1.5 Defense in depth

### 1.6 Least privilege 

### 1.7 Separation of responsibility 

### 1.8 Ensure complete mediation 

### 1.9 Shanon's Maxim 

### 1.10 Use fail-safe defaults 

### 1.11 Design security in from the start 

### 1.12 The Trusted Computing Base (TCB) 

### 1.13 TOCTTOU Vulnerabilities
