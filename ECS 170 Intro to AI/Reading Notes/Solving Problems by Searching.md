* Problem-Solving Agent
  * Atomic Representations : states of the world considered as wholes with no internal structure
* Goal-Based (Planning) Agent : use factored or structured representations
* Uninformed Search : algorithm given no information about the problem other than definition
* Informed Search : algorithm given guidance on where to look for solutions 

# Prolem Solving Agents
* Goal : set of world states
  * Goal Formulation : based on current situation and agent's performance
* Problem Formulation : process of decidin what actions and states to consider given a goal
* Unkown Environment : no additional information for agent, must take action at random
* Assumptions bout the Environment 
  * Observable Environment : agent knows the current state
  * Discrete Environment : finite actions to choose at any given state
  * Known Environment : agent knows which states are reached by each action
  * Deterministic Environment : each action has exactly one outcome
