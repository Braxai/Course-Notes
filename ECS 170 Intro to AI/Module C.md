Search has a goal state in mind whereas reasoning has a set of facts it infers from

Bayesian Belief Networks : concise representation of the joint probability of distribution 
* direct acyclic graph
* relationships between propositions are not deterministic
  * nodes : propositions
  * links : dependencies
  * probabilities show uncertainty in propositions and dependencies
* reasoning by merging semantic models (graph) and evidence 

Types of Semantic Models 
* direct cause
* indirect cause
* common cause
* common effect

Three Types of Queries -- Query Form : P(Facts to Infer | Evidence/Facts we know)
* Predictive : P(Effect | Cause)
* Abductive/Inductive (diagnostic) : P(Cause | Effect)
* Inter-causal Reasoning : P(Cause2 | Effect, Cause1)

Conditional Independence Assumption : burglarly conditional dependent upon John calling given the alarm went off
