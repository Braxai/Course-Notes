* platform and hardware components
* more specific vs open-ended
* scope size
* technical background of client
* time commitment of client
* IP requirement of client
* ML projects: data and GPU availability

# Projects
* 2 : standard mobile app
* 3 : mobile app, EMR connection required
* 5 : mobile app, HIPPA compliance
* 6 : Simmons, open ended
* 10 : Algorithm, excel/visual basic
* EEC 136A : working with another team, deliverable part is responsibility of our team, smaller scale
* 15 : Networks
* 16 : simulation tool, API
* 17 : open ended, visualization, client interaction
* 20 : input signal may be inconsistent from student clients
* 25 : mobile app
* 27 : mobile app
* 30-32 : lighter side deliverable
* 33 : open ended
* 34 : software + hardware
* 35 : great client, popular projects, larger expectation on deliverables because client is technically capable
